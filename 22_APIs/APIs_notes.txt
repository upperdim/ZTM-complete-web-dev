API (Application Programming Interface):
	It is a messenger.

	Takes a request, tells the system what to do.

	Skyscanner for example, uses airlines APIs to fetch flight data.

	Like a waiter. You sit at the table, order a meal from the waiter and they bring you.

	Ports like HDMI on the back of a TV is like an API too.

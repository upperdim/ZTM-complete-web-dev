props: data that is passed from parent component to child components
pure componenet / down component: only receivess a prop and outputs the same thing (pure function)
state: data that can move from child to parent
smart component: not a pure component, has a state. smart components has class syntax

lifecycle methods (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html): 
	components have several sections:
		mounting
		updating
		unmounting
		error handling

children: Component inside another components braces:
	<Scroll>
		<CardList robots={filteredRobots} />
	</Scroll>

components folder: UI components such as CardList, SearchBox, Scroll
containers folder: smart components, components that have state in it, lifecycle hooks, class syntax

npm run build: will build react app and minify etc. you have to run source code with `npm start`
	but built project will run upon clicking "index.html"
	*** for some reason it gets the paths wrong so you have to correct by hand. otherwise you will see blank screen

updating:
	after cloning an old repo for example `git clone <url>`
	`npm install` to install dependencies and
	`npm start` to make sure it works first
	`npm audit fix` as it suggests for fixing
	still shows vulnerabilities, because some of them are "breaking changes"
	`npm audit` will give some idea
	`npm update` will update package.json dependencies to max minor releases
	look through the changes and `npm audit fix --force`
	`npm audit` should show 0 vulnerabilities now
	make sure the app still works with `npm start`
	you can push to the repo now with `git push` etc.

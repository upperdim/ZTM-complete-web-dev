Think of frontend, backend and database as 3 seperate computers running on their own, in different computers as of now.

CREATE TABLE users (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(100),
    email text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    entries BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    joined TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE login (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    hash varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    email text UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

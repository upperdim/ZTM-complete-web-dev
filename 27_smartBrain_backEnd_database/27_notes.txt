Think of frontend, backend and database as 3 seperate computers running on their own, in different computers as of now.

CREATE TABLE users (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    name varchar(100),
    email text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    entries BIGINT DEFAULT 0,
    joined TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE login (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    hash varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    email text UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

Transactions:
    While they are in the same transaction, if one of 2 operations in 2 separate
        databases fail, the other one will fail too so that we won't have 
        inconsistencies between databases.

    For example we might store the profile info and login info of a user in 
        seperate tables. When registering, if one fails, other should fail too.

Figure out what functionality you might want and test it with Postman.

/                --> Root route, res = this is working
/signin          --> POST respond with success/fail
/register        --> POST respond with new user object
/profile/:userId --> GET  respond with user
/image           --> PUT  respond with updated user object (updates the uploaded photo count in order to determine rank)





res.json('signin') // this func is like `.send()` but in json format

Node.js:
	Javascript engine just like browsers Javascript engine v8
	Fast, popular for building servers
	Choice for most web apps, real-time comm, chat apps

	Can build robots too (Johnny-Five aka J5)

	`node` gives you the node shell

	there is no `window`
	there is `global`
	there is `process` which is the curring process of the node script

globalThis:
	ES2020 feature, points to window object (globalThis === window returns true)

	Why do we need globalThis while we have window too? globalThis works outside of browser too.
	ES2020 wanted to unify environments. globalThis === global returns true

	Even though globalThis has different properties in browser and node, we have a unified codebase.

require() and import:
	read `1_modules` and `2_modules_es_module_syntax` files' comments

3 Types of modules
------------------
1) modules (files) we create and import like `const c = require('./script2.js')`

2) modules that come already preinstalled with node like `const c = require('fs')` 
	which lets you interact with the filesystem(read files etc.)
	or `const c = require('http')` module which is used when building servers
	(these don't require "./" in the path, obviously)

3) something from NPM like `const c = require('nodemon')`
	* nodemon is a package that keeps your script alive and run it again whenever
		you make a change in the file. so that you don't need to re-run 
		`node <your script>` command over and over again while developing.
